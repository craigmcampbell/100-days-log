# 100 Days of Go
[Learning Go Repo](https://github.com/craigmcampbell/learning-go)

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2024

### Day 0: August 3rd, Sun
**Today's Progress**: Created a learning plan to reach my goals for learning Go.

- [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/craigmcampbell/projects/4)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/craigmcampbell/learning-go)

### Day 1: August 4th, Sun

**Today's Progress**: 
- Have one module consume another
- Used slices for random function responses and to loop first names
- Wrote a basic unit test
- Compiled and installed the application locally

**Thoughts:** 
It's interesting how if you are using multiple modules locally where imported modules aren't published yet, you have to run a command to map the namespace to the local version.

It's always interesting to see how each language handles things differently. For example - whether the first character of the function name is capitalized or not determines if it is public or private.

Questions
- It's so easy to install an application and run it from the command line, what are some helpful utilities I could create for streamlining dev work?

### Day 2: August 5th, Mon

- [Module Release Workflow](https://go.dev/doc/modules/release-workflow)
- [Workspaces](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Have one module consume another in a separate package via a workspace
- Get MySQL running in a container
- Import MySQL driver packages and successfully connected to the database instance

**Thoughts:** 
It might be a VS Code extension thing, but it's wonky importing a dependency. Save the file before using the dependency and the dependency reference gets removed.

Questions
- How would you privately host modules/packages to be consumed in workspaces?

### Day 3: August 6th, Tue

- [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Read multiple and single results from the database
- Add a new record to the database, return the inserted ID


**Thoughts:** 
- I love how simple it is to run an API endpoint
- The Gin context makes it really easy to pick things from it without jumping through hoops
- It's interesting that there is support for Generics, but you still define what types are acceptable for the function. For example: accepting a generic but it must be of type `int64` or `float64` - `func SumIntsOrFloats[K comparable, V int64 | float64](m map[K]V) V { }`.

### Day 4: August 7th, Wed

- [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Usage of fuzzing with unit tests to find edge cases
- Running `govulncheck` both from the command line and through the Go VS Code extension

**Thoughts:** 
- Fuzzing is awesome. It's an automated way to try out different test values, so you don't have to manually set them up. Can find edge cases and other issues. **Need to use the -fuzztime flag or it will run for a long time.**
- It is really cool that there are built in tools for vulnerability scanning.

**Notes:**
Byte vs Rune
1. Size: A byte is 8 bits, while a rune is 32 bits.
2. Character representation: byte can only represent 256 different characters (ASCII), while rune can represent over a million Unicode characters.
3. UTF-8 encoding: A single Unicode character can be represented by 1 to 4 bytes in UTF-8. A rune can hold any single Unicode character, regardless of its UTF-8 byte length. Good for international characters.

**Questions**
- What is the difference between `go get` vs `go install`?
