# 100 Days of Go

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2024

### Day 0: August 3rd, Sun
**Today's Progress**: Created a learning plan to reach my goals for learning Go.

- [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/craigmcampbell/projects/4)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/craigmcampbell/learning-go)

### Day 1: August 4th, Sun

**Today's Progress**: 
- Have one module consume another
- Used slices for random function responses and to loop first names
- Wrote a basic unit test
- Compiled and installed the application locally

**Thoughts:** 
It's interesting how if you are using multiple modules locally where imported modules aren't published yet, you have to run a command to map the namespace to the local version.

It's always interesting to see how each language handles things differently. For example - whether the first character of the function name is capitalized or not determines if it is public or private.

Questions
- It's so easy to install an application and run it from the command line, what are some helpful utilities I could create for streamlining dev work?

### Day 2: August 5th, Sun

- [Module Release Workflow](https://go.dev/doc/modules/release-workflow)
- [Workspaces](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Have one module consume another in a separate package via a workspace
- Get MySQL running in a container
- Import MySQL driver packages and successfully connected to the database instance

**Thoughts:** 
It might be a VS Code extension thing, but it's wonky importing a dependency. Save the file before using the dependency and the dependency reference gets removed.

Questions
- How would you privately host modules/packages to be consumed in workspaces?
